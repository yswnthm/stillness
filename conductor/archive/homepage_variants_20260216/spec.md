# Specification: Homepage Design Variants (`homepage_variants_20260216`)

## Overview
Based on client feedback requesting a "warm, light, welcoming, and open-hearted" vibe, we will develop four distinct homepage design variants. The core challenge is to balance a **"Luxury"** feel (high-end, prestigious, sophisticated) with a **"Fun"** energy (engaging, dynamic, not boring) to avoid a sterile or stiff appearance.

## Goals
- Deliver four high-fidelity homepage prototypes by Wednesday morning.
- Implement distinct aesthetic directions that blend luxury with playfulness.
- Incorporate client-provided imagery to make the designs feel authentic.

## Functional Requirements
- **Directory-Based Prototypes:** Each design will reside in its own directory (`design1/`, `design2/`, `design3/`, `design4/`) for independent development.
- **Color Palettes:**
    - **Variants 1, 3, and 4:** Must use the exact color palette from the existing main landing page.
    - **Variant 2:** Will use a unique "Earth Tone" palette (terracotta, sage, warm creams).
- **Section Completeness:** Each variant must include Hero, Intro/Mission, Services, Visual Stories, Testimonials, and Newsletter.

## Aesthetic Variants (Luxury + Fun Balance)
1. **Design 1 (Light & Airy):** High-end minimalism with playful micro-interactions, floating elements, and elegant thin typography.
2. **Design 2 (Earth Tone):** "Organic Luxury" using sophisticated textures (terracotta/sage) combined with a welcoming, "open-hearted" and playful layout.
3. **Design 3 (Modern Editorial):** Bold prestige typography and "high-fashion" asymmetric layouts with dynamic scrolling effects or surprising "fun" compositions.
4. **Design 4 (Soft Glow):** "Tech-Luxe" aesthetics with sophisticated mesh gradients and soft, "fun" glowing transitions and approachable rounded shapes.

## Out of Scope
- Full site-wide implementation (only the Homepage for each variant).
- Backend integration or functional forms.
